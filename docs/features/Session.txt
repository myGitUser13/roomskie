Feature : Maintaining registered/logged In session after user 
	  refreshes the page


Client - We need to find a way to save a session id after registration
       - Should always send the session id on object sent to the server
       - Should load chat.UI if there is a session

	window.sessionStorage.setItem(key,value); // key=sid, value= encrypted string coming from the server expires when tab is closed
	window.sessionStorage.getItem(key);

	window.localStorage = shared between tabs

Server - We need to find a way to save a session id after registration

       - session id persists even on sockets 'disconnect' event
       - session id should only be deleted once the client
         sends a logout event
       - server sends a session-destroy event




How do we do this.
	A. Upon reload or site visit always retrieve session storage first
		window.sessionStorage.getItem("cflysid"");
	1. session object is made by the server after successful registration
	2. session object is sent to the browser as pay load to the response object
		session object is a JSON object
		response.data.session = sessionObject
		session object contains
			session.id = a unique text encrypted associated with a User ( Peer.handle )
			       .data = {"handle" : "of the user"} / no password of course ung session id na pinaka password
	3. code on the client will parse the session data and save it to session storage(if remember me flag is not set-this will be later feature???)
	4. session object is always attached on every request object
    
    
    
    each event emits transaction
    
    
    Transaction types 
        registration
        new-message
        logout
        
        
    Register
    Message
    Logout
    
    
    inherits Transaction
    
    new Registration("handle");
        .login();
        .logout();
        
    new Message("message");
    
        
    
    Transaction is a prototype
        - session 
        - identity
        .register = "register"
        .newMessage = "new-message"
        .
